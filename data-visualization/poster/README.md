# Rhythmic Connection – Data Visualization of Spotify Songs

The project involved creating a poster featuring data visualizations related to music on Spotify. Our theme was "Rhythmic Connection" – we showcased various aspects of songs such as tempo, energy, and popularity to illustrate how rhythm and musical characteristics influence listeners' perception.

The goal was to combine visual aesthetics with data analysis, producing an engaging and clear poster that effectively presents musical data.
