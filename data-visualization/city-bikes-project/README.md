The project involved analyzing data from the New York City bike-sharing system (NYC Bikes). As part of the project, we developed an interactive web application using R Shiny to explore the data and visualize the analysis results. Additionally, we created maps with `ggplot2` to show spatial distributions and usage patterns of the bikes.

Technologies: R, Shiny, ggplot2
