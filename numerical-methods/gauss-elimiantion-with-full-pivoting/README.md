# Matrix Inversion Using Gaussian Elimination with Full Pivoting

This project involved implementing the Gaussian elimination method with full pivoting to compute the inverse of a non-singular matrix. Additionally, the condition number of the matrix was calculated to assess its numerical stability.

The project was completed as part of the Numerical Methods course, focusing on practical applications of matrix operations and numerical analysis techniques.
