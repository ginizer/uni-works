# Numerical Integration Using the Trapezoidal Method

In this project, the trapezoidal rule was implemented to approximate the value of the integral

\[
\int_a^b \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cos(kx) \right) dx,
\]

where the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cos(kx)\) is computed using the Goertzel algorithm.

The project demonstrates the application of numerical integration techniques combined with efficient computation of trigonometric sums.
