# Numerical Integration Using the Trapezoidal Method

In this project, the trapezoidal rule was implemented to approximate the value of the integral

∫ from a to b of (sum from k=1 to n of a_k * cos(kx)) dx,

where the sum (∑ from k=1 to n of a_k * cos(kx)) is calculated using the Goertzel algorithm.

The project demonstrates the application of numerical integration techniques combined with efficient computation of trigonometric sums.
