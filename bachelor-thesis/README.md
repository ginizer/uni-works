This paper addresses an ecological problem concerning bird species co-occurrence on islands, focusing on interdependence measures that reflect species competition. The problem is modeled using binary matrices with fixed row and column sums. It involves estimating the probability of observing interdependence measures as extreme as those in the data. To solve this, the paper uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for uniformly sampling such matrices. It also discusses the lumping of Markov chains as a technique relevant to the analysis.
