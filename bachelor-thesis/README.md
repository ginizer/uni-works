This paper focuses on solving an ecological problem related to the co-occurrence of bird
 species on individual islands. It introduces measures of interdependence that describe the
 level of competition among species. The initial ecological problem can be formulated in
 terms of matrices and concerns determining the probability of drawing a matrix consisting
 of zeros and ones (with fixed sums in rows and columns), for which the interdependence
 measures will have the same or greater values that those examined. The paper presents
 methods for generating matrices according to a uniform probability distribution using
 the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Additionally, it details the technique of lumping
 Markov chains, which proves useful within the scope of the problem addressed in the paper
