The goal of this project is to develop a classification method that achieves the highest possible **predictive performance**. This is a **binary classification problem**, and model performance will be evaluated using the **balanced accuracy** metric to account for any class imbalance in the data. This project was carried out as part of the course Introduction to Machine Learning.

Tools & Technologies: Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
